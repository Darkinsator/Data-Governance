# Defining Data Governance

- What is data governance
- Data governance elements
- The role of data culture
- Data governance readiness

Data governance basically a framework about proactively managingthe quality of your data to help your organisation achieve its strategy and goals.
It is all about managing data correctly .
If a company's data is managaed well it can spark immense growth and can become the most abundant and important lever for success.

Data Governance Versus Data Management

Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.

Data Governance versus Information Governance
Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. 

The interest here is in the data, not as much in the business context.

Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

# The advantages of implementing data governance in a organization:

- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value

- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search

# Leadership and Strategy:

The data governance program implemented in your program must align with the organizations strategy.
Data plays an important role in an organizations strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiency, so you must ensure there’s a clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.


# Roles and Responsibilies

To allow for a data governance program to success almost all members of the organization has to be responsible for something.
Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities.

# Policies, Processes, and Standards

Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.

# Metrics

The data governance program must have a way of measuring the performance to identify when it is delivering the intended results.Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.

# Tools

Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.

# Communications and Collaboration

With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. 


# Preparing for Data Governance

In order to implement data governance you first need to prepare the organization to be ready to accept it.

Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.

# Maturing Data Culture

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.
